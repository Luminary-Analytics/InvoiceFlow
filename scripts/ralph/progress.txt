# Ralph Progress Log
Started: Initial setup
---

## Codebase Patterns
- Ralph runs Claude Code in autonomous mode with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
- Each iteration reads prd.json, picks the next incomplete story, implements it, and commits
- Progress is tracked via git commits, prd.json updates, and this file
- This is a vanilla JS single-page app in public/index.html - no build system, no tests
- The `isPro` variable controls Pro features; stored in localStorage as `invoiceflow_pro`
- STRIPE_CONFIG at top of script holds payment link URLs for easy updates
- Use `new Function(code)` to check JavaScript syntax since there's no build/typecheck

## 2026-01-11 - US-001
- Implemented Stripe Payment Links integration
- Files changed: public/index.html
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - All code is in a single index.html file with inline JavaScript
  - The `isPro` global variable tracks Pro status, set from `localStorage.getItem('invoiceflow_pro')`
  - `checkProStatus()` updates the UI badge in header when Pro is active
  - URL parameters are handled at page load in `handleProUrlParams()`
  - The `checkout()` function redirects to Stripe Payment Links, no need for Stripe SDK
