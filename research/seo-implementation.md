## ✅ COMPLETED

### 1. Fixed Meta Tag URLs
The existing meta tags were pointing to `invoiceflow.app` (a competitor!). Updated all URLs to current domain.

**Changes:**
- `og:url` → `https://invoiceflow-x6lf.onrender.com`
- `canonical` → `https://invoiceflow-x6lf.onrender.com`
- Structured data `url` → `https://invoiceflow-x6lf.onrender.com`

### 2. Added robots.txt
```
User-agent: *
Allow: /
Sitemap: https://invoiceflow-x6lf.onrender.com/sitemap.xml
```

### 3. Added sitemap.xml
Basic sitemap with homepage. Will expand as blog/pages are added.
